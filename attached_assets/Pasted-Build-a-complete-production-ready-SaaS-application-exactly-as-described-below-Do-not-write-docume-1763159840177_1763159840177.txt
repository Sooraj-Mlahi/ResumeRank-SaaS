Build a complete, production-ready SaaS application exactly as described below.
Do not write documentation, explanations, or thesis-style text — deliver only the full working codebase with a clean, professional project structure.

⚙️ Tech Stack Requirements

Use ONLY the following stack:

Next.js (latest) — frontend + backend API routes

TypeScript

Tailwind CSS

Prisma ORM

PostgreSQL database

NextAuth for authentication

Google OAuth

Outlook / Microsoft OAuth

OpenAI API (for resume scoring and ranking)

Email APIs:

Gmail API

Microsoft Graph API (Outlook)

📌 Core Features to Implement
1. Authentication

Using NextAuth, implement:

Login with Google

Login with Microsoft Outlook

Store users in the database

Protect all internal routes behind authentication

2. Fetching CVs From Email Inbox

Create backend API routes + background jobs that:

Connect to the logged-in user’s Gmail OR Outlook inbox

Search for emails containing CV/resume attachments

Supported formats:

PDF

DOC

DOCX

Download attachments

Extract text using libraries (pdf-parse, docx-parser, etc.)

Save extracted CV data + metadata in PostgreSQL

3. Resume Scoring & Ranking

User submits a job prompt.

System must:

Process all stored CVs

Use OpenAI embeddings or GPT scoring model

Score each resume 0–100

Rank resumes best → worst

Save scores + highlights + weaknesses in DB

Each ranked resume entry should include:

Candidate name

Score

Strengths

Weaknesses

Download original CV

View extracted text

4. Dashboard UI/UX (Professional Quality)

Build a polished, modern interface with:

Pages:

Login page

Dashboard

“Fetch CVs from Email” page

“Rank Resumes” page

Professional layout

Clean spacing

Responsive design

Smooth animations

Light/Dark mode

Modern tables and cards

Intuitive UX flow

🎯 Output Requirements

A complete working Next.js SaaS application

Full backend + full frontend

Fully wired authentication

Email fetching working

CV ranking system working

Professional UI/UX

Clean, maintainable folder structure

No documentation

Use environment variables for:

DATABASE_URL

NEXTAUTH_SECRET

GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID

GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET

MICROSOFT_CLIENT_ID

MICROSOFT_CLIENT_SECRET

OPENAI_API_KEY
